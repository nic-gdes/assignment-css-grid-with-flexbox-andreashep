        <p>Sheri’s background work history and extreme work ethics have been a huge advantage and a real benefit for her clients.  With her 6 years of being a builder, along with working with her husband in excavation, her extensive background in both building and excavation has contributed towards her knowledge and expertise in her real estate career.  She has physically been down in the ditches installing numerous drain fields, septic systems, and sewer lines.  She can point out the difference of an older 3 tab roof verses an updated architectural roof, explain the difference between an active and passive radon system, and can try to determine on how difficult it may be to add that 3rd bathroom in the basement depending on the location of the plumbing and where the elevation of the septic or sewer line is entering the home if it is even visible.  She  will normally  check out the electrical panel boxes to see if they are a Federal Pacific brand, for they have been recalled, along with the era of when the LP siding had the class action suit.</p>
        
        <p>The excavation background has been a huge benefit for her clients that are looking at raw land with the dream of building their own home.  She has a general knowledge of the different types of soil, with the potential types of septic systems they could be up against.  She’s always looking for the perfect slope to provide the desirable daylight walk-out basement, and points out to her clients on where the sun rises and sets, so they can determine on how they may want to design their home.  Evening shade is perfect for those summer BBQ’s!</p>
        
        <p>With Sheri also having a long lasting love for horses since she was a small girl, she has a tremendous amount of knowledge in the equestrian properties.  She owns a beautiful black quarter horse that she is very proud to say has been used in a therapeutic riding program for handicapped children and adults.  She also has a gorgeous Appaloosa Mule in which she has shown and won against the horses.  The many years of horse ownership is also a large benefit for her equestrian clients.</p>
